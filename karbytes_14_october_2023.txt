Today I removed the social media posts on my Twitter, Minds, LinkedIn, and Patreaon pages which link to the web page of my blogging website named karbytes_07_october_2023 and the web page of my blogging website named 13_october_2023 after being informed via phone call that I have been terminated from the job I started working at on Monday of this week (apparently for having too many packages I packed not pass quality inspection standards (but I suspect that management did not seriously intend to hire me for longer than a week because they thought I was not sufficiently socially conformist from the start and just wanted to help give me some clues which I would not be able to glean if unemployed about how I should proceed at my next job: not acting like I am any more affluent than anyone else in my assigned role))..

Well I am back to being unemployed again and think it may be wisest for now on to discontinue publishing content in public GitHub repositories about job searching, employment, and my personal logistical and economic situation because such things are laborious to have to keep making updates about because of how little control I seem to have over what those updates are about (because, when it comes to earning a paycheck, it seems I have to act as if I am not the sole manager of a public and increasingly monolithic brand and, instead, act as if I do nothing but hang out and do errands for friends and family (because to do more is apparently "too affluent" and "too vain" because it would amount to flaunting nice things which most other people in my life are supposedly not accustomed to regularly being involved in)). 

It may be the case that, after today, I will make a few exceptions to what I wrote in the previous paragraph (if not entirely dismiss what I wrote in this journal as mere brainstorming and little else). Perhaps I will decide that it is in karbytes' best interest to share more data pertaining to my job search and employment experiences. Based on what I have experienced so far, it seems that it is better to error on the side of saying too little than saying too much about myself online during the time in which I am considered to be a "new hire" at whatever company I am offered a job at. That is because saying too little means that I have more brain capacity available to focus on conforming to my work environment instead of on worrying about my personal brand appearing to be on hold and daresay nonexistent for the duration of my shift. It is important that I be perpetually "chill" (i.e. alert, calm, relaxed, and unpretentious) while at or near my place of employment (and to handle emergencies accordingly). It is important that I just let people next to me incessantly babble on and on making rude comments about me and giving me antagonistic looks while I just patiently and nonchalantly tolerate their presence without showing any signs of being agitated. People will likely continue to try to pick fights with me. Because I want to be able to keep my job rather than act incapacitated by other people acting in ways I consider to be rude or obnoxious, I will avoid complaining about other people's conduct and do my best to not make those people think that I am surveiling them nor writing notes about them.

At the heart of what I think humanity's contemporary struggles are is unreasonably prolonged fossil fuels dependendence. So much about the kinds of employment situations I have been involved in recently seem to implicitly require that I commute via car as my only commute method (unless I live within a ten minute's walking distance from the employer). Bicycles are implicitly discouraged and so is taking public transportation (except for, perhaps, ride share services such as Uber or Lyft). The (gasoline powered) Toyota Matrix I have been using to commute to work during the past five days is currently parked in its "default" parking space labeled 666 in the East Dublin BART parking garage. I am back to primarly getting around via BART and bicycle unless I think I have a good enough reason to drive that car for some specific task. Perhaps I need to do a much better job exemplifying environmental sustainability (and doing so would be countercultural according to those who are still very dependent on the fossil fuels monopoloy and on the impedence of scientific and technological progress for the sake of maintaining a culturally outdated and ecologically unsustainable status quo).

Lastly, I would hazard a guess that what is at the heart of humanity's "struggle" to implement more ecologically sustainable and socially beneficial infrastructure and practices is "tyranny of the masses": too many people having little more to defer to than some very assertive chauvinist male's demands and threats and not enough people aspiring to always increase their consciousness and agency levels. The poor blue collar man's ego seems to be literally the most important entity throughout the civilization I live in. Society better revolve around him and everyone better conform to his whims automatically and with minimal awareness of promoting such deference and anti intellectualism. I might as well be the only green party voter for miles wherever I go. 

Based on what I know, humanity currently has everything in needs in terms of material resources and knowledge to implement sustainable and humane alternatives to what is currently in place within that civilization. If such changes are not made relatively soon, it is likely that the human species will go extinct by its own negligence to upkeep the planet (i.e. for making machismo and related posturing and pettiness mongering more important than keeping Earth habitable for current and future residents).
