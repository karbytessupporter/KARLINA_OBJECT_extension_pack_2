I was recently offered a warehouse job in Newark, California and my first shift at that new job is next week. I plan to upload a screenshot of my first paycheck from that job and a screenshot of the hours I log on my timesheet before my first paycheck to this GitHub repository some time within the next three weeks. I initially plan to buy a new pre-assembled bicycle from Walmart and paying to have it set up by specialists at a bicycle repair shop (because my current bicycle is too small to ride comfortably for long distances). Once I get my new and better-fitting bike, I will put the old bike. I may even go on a bicycling trip around the entire bay of the San Francisco Bay Area during some weekend. Some other things I plan to do while working as as follows:

On my personal websites and on GitHub, I will add new content no less than once per month and content such as very well hand-written solutions to math problems (as image files), new software applications and related technical documentation (as green web pages on Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com), new philosophical prose (as orange web pages on Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com), book or movie reviews (as blog post web pages on Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and/or plain-text files on GitHub), psychedelic trip reports (as blog post web pages on Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and/or plain-text files on GitHub), and any other personal achievements or data I think is worth archiving and showcasing as a sort of trophy on my cyberspace platform.

Besides trying to maximize my well being and enjpyment of life, my primary objective in life is to promote and to cultivate my personal brand referred to as karbytes.
