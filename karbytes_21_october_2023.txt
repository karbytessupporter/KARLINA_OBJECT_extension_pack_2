Warning: in the file named karlina_object_winter_2023_abridged_print_pages_0_to_17.pdf and in the file named karlina_object_winter_2023_abridged_print_pages_0_to_17.txt in the GitHub repository which contains this file, there is at least one error in the PUBLIC_DOMAIN section (and that error is the duplication of the section of that web page content which defines the term OPEN_SOURCE).

At the time the content of this file is published as a web page on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and shared as a social media post on karbytes' Twitter, Minds, LinkedIn, and Patreon profiles), a complete paper print out of the file named karlina_object_winter_2023_abridged_print_pages_0_to_17.pdf and a complete paper print out the file named karlina_object_winter_2023_abridged_print_pages_18_to_30.pdf exist in their own respective three-ring binders and such that each of the pieces of paper in those print outs is encased inside of transparent plastic sheet protectors. 

(Note that each of the plastic sheet protectors which is in either of the two binders contains one or else two pieces of paper (and each of those pieces of paper is a page of the binder's respective PDF file such that the first of two adjacent PDF print out pages is facing outward through the front side of its sheet protector while the second of those two adjacent PDF print out pages is facing outward thought the back side of that same sheet protector).

Also at the time this file is published as a web page on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and shared as a social media post on karbytes' Twitter, Minds, LinkedIn, and Patreon profiles), three M_DISC optical discs have been burned with the zip file contents of each of the following GitHub repositories (as each of those GitHub repositories were as of their final commits for the day 22_OCTOBER_2023 in terms of Pacific Standard Time):

repository_0: https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack /**(public)*/

repository_1: https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_2 /**(public)*/

repository_2: https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG /**(public)*/

repository_3: https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karbytes_basement_0/ /**(private)*/

repository_4: https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/SOUND_TRACK_LOOPER_private /**(private)*/

For safe and compact keeping, I intend to keep the two binders containing an abridged plain-text print out of the latest 21_OCTOBER_2023 version of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com inside of a metal box (either a safe or else an unplugged microwave oven) in my room at my house of legal residence. 

For safe and keeping, I also intend to keep the three M_DISCs which have been burned with the aforementioned GitHub repositories inside of the front inner pockets of the binders and such that each of the M_DISCs is inside of its own original jewel compact disc case.
