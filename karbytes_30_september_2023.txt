(The following confession is half-baked and feelings-based rather than facts-based and well-formulated and not something the author necessarily believes is true).

Confession: I cannot help but think that I am the only person who seriously wants me to keep on living. I get the sense that other people think I should deteriorate and cease to exist after a certain point and hence seem opposed to me attempting to or acting as though I have the ability to extend my life and agency for an indefinitely long period instead of dutifully keeling over and dying on behalf of the breeder agenda to keep the turnover rate of humanity feverishly high and the knowledge retention rate low (because too much knowledge about how the system works is a threat to its perpetuation).
