Based on the news reading I have done within the past 24 hours (in addition to what else I have learned about the world during my thirty three contiguous years of existence as a human individual), I have concluded the following:

(a) generations of human younger than mine will take measures to effectively mitigate human-caused climate disruption and ecological destruction because such people will have to in order for them to personally survive and to be comfortable.

(b) generations of human older than mine have been reluctant to take measures to effectively mitigate human-caused climate disruption and ecological destruction because such people do not expect to personally have to be inconvenienced by such things (because it's for the younger generations to deal with instead of for them).

I am reluctant to release this note to the public because it seems rather inflammatory and conflict mongering instead of explicitly about solution-finding using innovative scientific and technological approaches.

(Art is useful for catharsis, integrating lessons in a personalized way, and spreading ideas in attention-grabbing and emotionally-compelling ways but I do not consider art to be as noble of a pursuit nor the same as doing professional quality science and engineering).

(I do not necessarily intend to imply that any particular human or even most humans of a certain demographic have been intentionally invested in habitual practices which cause serious harm to survival and thrival of future human inhabitants of Planet Earth. I think more than 99% of human-caused climate disruption and ecological destruction is not intentionally created (but knowingly is a different story)).
