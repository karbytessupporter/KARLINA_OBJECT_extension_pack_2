A project which I would like to do as soon as possible (ideally but not necessarily during the weekend while renting a motel room and after having sufficient funds from working at my new warehouse job in Newark) is purchase a high quality journal and archival quality black ink to write the entire text context of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com into that journal. I already placed an order for three more blank M_DISCs onto which to enscribe all of the digital files which comprise the GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack (in addition to a few other GitHub repositories), but having the most essential content (i.e. intellectual property) which comprises the karbytes empire in some kind of hard visually-accessible (instead of encoded as sequences of binary sy,bols which require a spcial type of information processing machine and respective logic to decode into the phenomenally identical content (i.e. intellectual property) gives me peace of mind to work towards implementing at what I deem to be a reasonable speed and overall cost.

I look forward to having my own hard copy book (albeit abridged) non cyberspace (and 100% non-electronic solid-state) copy of the intellectual property which comprises the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com.

Perhaps a better idea for me to implement would be simply paying to have the text content which I would otherwise transcribe meticulously by hand into a paper journal printed onto paper (and for me to stow that paper inside of plastic sleeves which I keek in a binder).
