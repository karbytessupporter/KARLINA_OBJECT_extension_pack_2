This morning (after locking my bicycle onto a bicycle rack near a public park), I noticed that the back tire was flat. I tried putting some air in it using my hand-powered portable bicycle tire air pump and then proceeded to continue riding the bicycle for approximately fifty more meters before the tire ruptured (which rendered the bicycle unrideable). This week I plan on taking the bicycle to a local bicycle repair shop (using the car I have been borrowing from my parents to get it their instead of dragging or carrying the bicycle while walking (and I literally pushed the box containing the pre-assembled bicycle which I ordered and picked up from a Walmart store in Pleasanton for approximately a mile of cumulative walking to a bicycle repair shop to have the bicycle professionally set up for approximately $100).

I am not sure whether my bicycle tire went flat due to the tire becoming brittle from exposure to pressure, temperature changes, and sharp objects on the ground such as thorns from certain kinds of weeds or whether my bicycle tire went flat as a result of humans deliberate trying to sabotage my goals.

If humans did deliberately vandalize my bicycle during the past 24 hours, I imagine those people did so because they are opposed to me transporting myself without a car. Perhaps they do not want me to succeed at proving that bicycling and BART rides are a cost effective and ecologically sustainable alternative to driving a petroleum powered car because it goes against those people's agenda to keep as many people as possible confined to cars (especially petroleum powered cars). Perhaps their masculinity is threatened by the prospect of a female bodied human adult traveling around so independently, freely, cheaply whilst appearing quite macho and for not lugging with me everywhere I go the means to have spontaneous sexual encounters in the sealed vessel which is my car and to easily transport luggage and passengers instead of just myself.
