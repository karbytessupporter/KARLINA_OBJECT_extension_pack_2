This morning (after locking my bicycle onto a bicycle rack near a public park), I noticed that the back tire was flat. I tried putting some air in it using my hand-powered portable bicycle tire air pump and then proceeded to continue riding the bicycle for approximately fifty more meters before the tire ruptured (which rendered the bicycle unrideable). This week I plan on taking the bicycle to a local bicycle repair shop (using the car I have been borrowing from my parents to get it their instead of dragging or carrying the bicycle while walking (and I literally pushed the box containing the pre-assembled bicycle which I ordered and picked up from a Walmart store in Pleasanton for approximately a mile of cumulative walking to a bicycle repair shop to have the bicycle professionally set up for approximately $100).

I am not sure whether my bicycle tire went flat due to the tire becoming brittle from exposure to pressure, temperature changes, and sharp objects on the ground such as thorns from certain kinds of weeds or whether my bicycle tire went flat as a result of humans deliberate trying to sabotage my goals.

If humans did deliberately vandalize my bicycle during the past 24 hours, I imagine those people did so because they are opposed to me transporting myself without a car. Perhaps they do not want me to succeed at proving that bicycling and BART rides are a cost effective and ecologically sustainable alternative to driving a petroleum powered car because it goes against those people's agenda to keep as many people as possible confined to cars (especially petroleum powered cars). Perhaps their masculinity is threatened by the prospect of a female bodied human adult traveling around so independently, freely, cheaply whilst appearing quite macho and for not lugging with me everywhere I go the means to have spontaneous sexual encounters in the sealed vessel which is my car and to easily transport luggage and passengers instead of just myself.

I do not like how chauvinist my writings have sounded during the past week (if not longer). Now that I am sitting in a place I have not sat at in what seems like at least one year instead of the small region I have been hanging out mostly outdoors near, it is more palpable to me than it was where I have been hanging out lately that I have been hard core role playing some misogynist, racist, and ablist pig ape. I want to apologize but as soon as I do other people crowd around me and attempt to interrupt me and to influence my writings (which makes me not want to continue fleshing out this "apology"). Yes I think certain types of people more so than other types of people have been aggressively intrusive and corrosive to my agenda. It seems that they are desperate to sabotage me so that I remain their destitute and oppressed prisoner and target of harassment. They are so disgustingly forceful about inserting themselves in my personal space to the extent that I would call them rape apologists. Such people seem to prevent themselves and each other (and anyone they can dominate) from doing much other than live in squalor with few hobbies other than fucking. Such is a vehicle for effectively propagating the human population (irregardless of the cost and sustainability and public health considerations). I figured that if I did not practically have my uterus surgically removed, I would be covertly raped by being prevented from having sufficient quality alone time to introspect. Rather than meditate, the patriarchal system would seemingly rather me be constantly preoccupied with banal propaganda so that I eventually assimilate to the system as another wombed individual to exploit like a prized natural resource which is never supposed to be free to live without some patriarch owner stalking and manipulating her.

I did not want to get so shrill in this journal entry, but I did! I turned into a shrill feminazi squawking vainly about some conflationary patriarchy. I am the only person I know who is turned off by certain things I see trending amidst the people in my midst. I will try not to get too specific in public writings nor even in private writings. I expect that "those people" are on a crazed mission to drive me to self destruction so that they can rejoice in my suffering because to them such sadist voyeurism is a superior form of comfort than is investing in creative endeavors which do not force people to take damage against their will. People harass me so frequently and with more desperation within the past seven days than I have seen in my life. I hear those self righteous tenors preaching at me in a reprimanding way for focusing my intention inward instead of on the objects of his interest. That's what his bitch on a leash of a girlfriend is for: to lavish him with her loyalty and servitude and to renounce her individuality apart from being some man's property.

To be clear, my intention is to remain single and perhaps even celibate for life and to generally favor solitary hobbies over social activities.

Because I strongly condone freedom of speech (and thought), I strongly oppose censorship (unless the censorship consists merely of preventing accounts from getting hacked and the data in those accounts shared or tampered with without the account owner's permission).

Because I strongly condone freedom of speech, I make an effort to not complain if people call me names and pronouns I do not like being referred to as (or if those people barrage me with insults and taunts in general) firstly because doing so seems to be what those drama mongering bullies want me to do (which they can then conveniently use as an excuse to escalate the interaction into a bigger fight because such bullies are too unhappy to not want to refrain from deliberately trying to make other people less happy to vainly compensate for one's own happiness debt). 

Also, this bike repair job is costing me more than twice as much time and money as I thought it would cost because I went to the shittier of the two bicycle stores I typically go to (and the non shittier store is closed today and today and tomorrow I have been ordered to appear at East County Hall of Justice). The shittier place has grossly inflated prices compared to the other place.

I take back what I said about one of the two shops being shittier than the other. Both deserve at least 4/5 star ratings from me in my opinion because both got the job done to my satisfaction.

What I especially appreciate about what the bike repair crew did today was raise the seat such that it no longer falls down and is a much more ergonomic height for me. I did not even ask for that adjustment. Riding the bike has never felt so good because I can just keep going without falling into positions which put a damaging amount of strain on my knees.
