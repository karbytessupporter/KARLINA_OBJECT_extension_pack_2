Omniscience necessarily includes a lack of skepticism. To be omniscient would require feeling extremely certain that all questions are exhaustively and accurately answered.

A few years ago I published a short quote on Minds dot Com which is identical or very similar to the following quoted string of text: "Skepticism is the doorway to choice." I remember seeing a refrigerator magnet at my old colleague's house around that time which said something like, "Every moment is a doorway to the eternal present." I wanted to make my own autonomy-oriented version of that quote and imply that agency (i.e. the ability to imagine the future and to make voluntary decisions) is a function of intelligence (i.e. the ability to gather and synthesize information in ways which make it possible to relatively accurately model reality based on empirical and logical data inputs).

Lately I have been thinking a lot about the hypothetical entity I have already written some professional quality articles about on Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. My latest hypothesis is not that all of reality is neatly contained within one ubiquitous container but, rather, that several of such containers of space-time exist either concurrently or at different times (with respect to nature as a theoretical unified whole which may possibly experience time passing according to its own frame of reference and not according to some frame of reference which encompasses a smaller scope of phenomena than what nature encompasses) and such that many of those containers never overlap. If nature is objectively just a disjointed map, there may or may not be some sentient frame of reference observing that entire map at all times. If there is no sentient attention span encompassing that entire map in every one of its configurations, then it would be logical to say that omniscience does not (at this time in nature's timeline) exist.
