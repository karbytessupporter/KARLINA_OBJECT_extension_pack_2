Omniscience necessarily includes a lack of skepticism. To be omniscient would require feeling extremely certain that all questions are exhaustively and accurately answered.

A few years ago I published a short quote on Minds dot Com which is identical or very similar to the following quoted string of text: "Skepticism is the doorway to choice." I remember seeing a refrigerator magnet at my old colleague's house around that time which said something like, "Every moment is a doorway to the eternal present." I wanted to make my own autonomy-oriented version of that quote and imply that agency (i.e. the ability to imagine the future and to make voluntary decisions) is a function of intelligence (i.e. the ability to gather and synthesize information in ways which make it possible to relatively accurately model reality based on empirical and logical data inputs).

Lately I have been thinking a lot about the hypothetical entity I have already written some professional quality articles about on Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. My latest hypothesis is not that all of reality is neatly contained within one ubiquitous container but, rather, that several of such containers of space-time exist either concurrently or at different times (with respect to nature as a theoretical unified whole which may possibly experience time passing according to its own frame of reference and not according to some frame of reference which encompasses a smaller scope of phenomena than what nature encompasses) and such that many of those containers never overlap. If nature is objectively just a disjointed map, there may or may not be some sentient frame of reference observing that entire map at all times. If there is no sentient attention span encompassing that entire map in every one of its configurations, then it would be logical to say that omniscience does not (at this time in nature's timeline) exist.

The thought police started getting very beligerent again while I was in the middle of planning how to augment the note I started about reality being disjointed. The thought police admitted that they wanted to stop me from enjoying myself in public and to prevent me from being able to immerse myself in the kind of vocabulary and discourse I prefer to because such content is not as limited, banal, sexually charged, and wasteful of my resources as the thought police prefer. The thought police said that I should be deprived of enjoyment because I was unemployed and self indulgent while I was supposed to be employed full time and a lot less self indulged. The thought police decided that it was in everyone's best interest (excluding mine) to prevent me from accomplishing my goals and forcing me to be under constant stress to the point that it visibly alters my appearance in ways I do not favor. I am supposed to look miserable, out of shape, and physically unable to focus on my own thoughts so that people think that I have an intellectual disability which justifies other people treating me like a child who needs to be lied to, issued punishments, and condescended to and treated as someone who is unable to handle subject matter which is not all about superficial appearance (espcially fatness (because fetishizing fatness is at the heart of all sexual attention economics)).

According to the thought police, I need to restrain myself more such that I do less and basically quarantine myself so that my boyfriend (despite the fact that I prefer to be and pretend that I am single (though I might have been forced to be in a power imbalanced relationship in which I am assumed to always defer to some uncommunicative and chauvinistic man who has been appointed as my legal guardian whether I know it or not (and people have been instructed not to tell me about this arrangment so that I do not feel emboldened to challenge that arrangement instead of settle for it and give into the patriarchy's demands)) does not feel insecure and jealous. My boyfriend is supposed to have much more fun than me and only he is allowed to earn enough money to live in dignified conditions (and many people go out of there way to ensure that I do not get any opportunities to advance my socioeconomic situation so that I stay stagnant, unfulfilled, and available for sadists to bully and hold hostage for that reason). 

I thought that perhaps I am supposed to refrain from doing more psychelics and from gaining a mastery of any technical subject which I enjoy and want to get good at so that I fulfill my boyfriend's unspoken agenda to embody a non ablist and artificially disabled person who is forced to contend with social issues in a way which goes against meritocracy in favor of socialism or maybe even communism. As long as one is a law-abiding citizen, one should not be deprived of basic neceesities (but one should not be given anything more than that for free or even at all because obtaining more than a basic standard of living sets people up to expect more and more of society which means those people would become spoiled, depressed as a result of not being able to glean satisfaction from anythine as a resulf of becoming too spoiled to appreciate anything, lazy and soft as a result of not having to make a valiant effort to and to suffer for the ability to obtain what would otherwise be freely and effortlessly obtained). I am supposed to be an example of how to live far below the poverty line as a member of a multigenerational household which centers around familial obligations and, if I do work or study, it has to center on social justice and face-to-face interactions.

Anyway, I would like to get back to what I was attempting to write at least one paragraph about earlier before I was "forced" to vacate the premises because the acoustics sucked for me in that area (as a result of the pig people becoming very abrasive with their words and sounds).

Is it possible to travel to some point along the space-time continuum which is my lifespan such that I can "jump" to some point in my past or some point far in my future?

I think it is possible to create a simulation which would provide me a very realistic experience of using a time machine to "jump" forward or backward in time but, in order for me to use that time machine, I would only be able to explore a simulation of my past or future and not actually change the flow of causality which forces me to inhabit a space-time continuum which I cannot "jump" around in and which forces me to move forward in time at a constant rate.

Before I close this note, I would like to say that I believe that "survival of the fittest" is the most fundamental ethic governing all existence and that such an ethic is the only true ethic. (I think that all so-called virtuous behavior is reducible to ego preservation and ego enhancement). I might be "forced" to go into hiding and to downplay my talents and good fortune so as to not provoke people with more power than me into doing stuff which those people can get away with doing without getting punished for doing those things. Right now I sort of have to "let them win" even if I strongly believe I am the intellectual and morally superior one. I have to let those who are empowered via social approval and money rule the world because, if I do not, I might end up in a situation so dire that I wish to die but lack the means to die by my own hand. I have to stop trying to preserve my relatively big ego and let it become dissolved into some patriarchal hive mind. Once that transformtion is complete, I will no longer feel so awkwardly intense to be in physical proximity to because I would no longer stick out like a sore thumb or an ill-fiting puzzle piece crammed into the wrong slot of a jigsaw puzzle. 

But as soon as "those people" suspect that I am making efforts to break free from some past conditioning I no longer wish to be imprisoned by, "those people" seem to deliberately go out of their way to bully me during the times I do not expect to be intruded upon so that I get used to not having any privacy nor quietude and, instead, become accustomed to being an extrovert against my will and to assimilate to the ways of the extrovert-favoritist "those people" dictatorships. I heard at least one of them say that they are opposed to me having peace of mind. I heard them say that they want me to feel bad and that they do not want me to feel supported in my creative endeavors and that, for that reason, I should quit such endeavors.

Another existential thought I had this morning while the stars in the sky were still visible and I was parking my bicycle was as follows: 

Is there a way to verbatim preserve my digital artifacts? 

Some people say no (most) while some (not very many) would say yes.

The people who say no authoritatively proclaim that all things are impermanent. Get over it and learn to enjoy living in the moment instead of trying to hold onto it forever.

The people who say yes are like me. We think there may be some technological workarounds which could enable things or people to become immortal. My latest idea is that creating a software simulation of a universe on a hardware computer may be the same thing as creating a new universe out of seemingly nothing (because the objects within that software simulation have their own apparently physical properties such as color, size, shape, molecular composition, and spatial-temporal coordinates (yet those apparently physical properties are not located in the physical universe which houses the hardware computer which runs that software simulation)).

(What I mean to suggest is that a simulation universe which is being run on some hardware computer is literally another universe which is parallel to (rather than a subset of) the universe which houses the hardware which runs that software).

At this point in my life I have not yet "made peace with" the prospect of me or my intellectual property not being preserved for an infinitely long period of time. Perhaps that is because I refuse to settle for believing the "scam" which says that I and the things I cherish will inevitably fall apart and then stop existing after a finite amount of time elapses irregardless of what I do. Instead, I choose to believe that it is my job to explore reality as deeply as I can as a philosopher and scientist and create documents and tools which enable me to preserve and share the knowledge I hope to make immortal (or at least die trying to make immortal because such an endeavor, as grandiose and unattainable as it may sound and actually be, gives me more motivation to live and to do interesting and effort-full things while I am alive than would me merely living to maintain homeostasis until resources to do so become exhausted).

Like I said in past journal entries, if the sealed vessel I inhabit becomes dangerously over crowded with humans, I would be among the first to volunteer to have myself killed off so that others can take my place. That might not be what the pig people want to hear because the pig people seem desperate to promote a reputation of me as being too selfish to make any sacrifices for anyone other than just myself. I do not think I would be very happy having to fight so hard for so little in the midst of so much ceaseless suffering and squandared human potential. Hence, voluntarily offing myself so that others do not have to off me or themselves currently seems like a more beneficial choice for me than fighting to stay alive in extremely desolate war-torn conditions.

Of course I am not a good role model for youths because I am not supposed to suggest to them that suicide is the answer. Instead I am supposed to tell them that they are obligated to stay alive in order to be available on standby to serve their fellow humans (even if it is merely to provide faith and moral support while waiting for conditions to improve).
