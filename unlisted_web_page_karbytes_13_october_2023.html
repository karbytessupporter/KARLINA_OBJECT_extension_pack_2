A project which I would like to do as soon as possible (ideally but not necessarily during the weekend while renting a motel room and after having sufficient funds from working at my new warehouse job in Newark) is purchase a high quality <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal</a> and archival quality black ink to write the entire text context of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> into that journal. I already placed an order for three more blank <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-DISC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M_DISCs</a> onto which to inscribe all of the digital files which comprise the GitHub repository named <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack</a> (in addition to a few other GitHub repositories), but having the most essential content (i.e. intellectual property) which comprises the karbytes empire in some kind of hard visually-accessible (instead of encoded as sequences of binary symbols which require a special type of information processing machine and respective logic to decode into the phenomenally identical content (i.e. intellectual property) gives me peace of mind to work towards implementing at what I deem to be a reasonable speed and overall cost.

I look forward to having my own hard copy book (albeit abridged) non cyberspace (and 100% non-electronic solid-state) copy of the intellectual property which comprises the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com.

Perhaps a better idea for me to implement would be simply paying (at a public copymat) to have the text content which I would otherwise transcribe meticulously by hand into a paper journal (and for me to stow that paper inside of plastic sleeves which I keep in a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_binder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binder</a>). I will bring a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB flash drive</a> with all the respective files on it and have them each printed (as human-readable text etched in black ink on white rectangular pieces of paper which are 8 inches in width and 11 inches in height) one time. I will likely place at least one of the three aforementioned M_DISCs (in its original jewel case) into the Karlina Object binder.
