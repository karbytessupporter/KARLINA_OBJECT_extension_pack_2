This week karbytes has at least two job interviews scheduled. Based on karbytes' prior experience using Indeed dot Com to get a local job, karbytes thinks that karbytes will have at least a seasonal part time job within one month from 03_OCTOBER_2023. During this job search phase of karbytes' life, karbytes has only applied for back of house rather than front of house jobs. In other words, karbytes has only recently applied to warehouse and stocking jobs; not to direct customer service jobs. karbytes wants to minimize the time it spends interacting with unprofessional humans (and unprofessional humans are those who conduct themselves in a manner which karbytes deems to be petty, caustic, wasteful, conflict-mongering, and contemptible).
