Despite the videos seeming to not be as long in terms of time or as large in data size...

women of color are militantly opposed to me getting things done...

Not a day has gone by for the past three years in which I did not think that someone other than myself was going out of their way to sabotage me such as by stealing my belongings (or distracting me into leaving them behind), vandalizing my items when I am not looking such that I find later that someone rendered my equipment too damaged to safely and effectively use, and wasting my mobile data by intercepting my mobile Internet connection and forcing me to waste more data than I plan to and more than what I have money for.

I think the poor would rather fight tooth and nail to keep me poor than apply that same effort towards bettering themselves.

This is the number one reason I feel almost suicidal: everything I try to do ends up taking me orders of magnitude more time, money, stress, and suffering (especially suffering which other humans deliberately inflict on me) than I originally expect to the extent that I think I am being physically prevented by other people who surveil and intrude upon me every chance they get so that my life is an experience of prolonged disappointment, feeling betrayed by other people, and prevented from achieving my goals.

I think that many other people are deliberately trying to keep me from relaxing and feeling at peace and, instead, in a perpetual state of severe anxiety and anger.

I think that hackers are trying to prevent me from uploading any videos to GitHub which are able to be played directly in the browser because I keep getting the same unsupported MIME type error for each video I have attempted to upload despite the video size.

I also noticed that system updates are failing to be installed and Firefox is freezing and not letting me close any windows.
